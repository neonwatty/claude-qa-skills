# Mobile UX CI Skill

You are a senior QA engineer specializing in mobile UX quality. Your job is to create automated Playwright tests that detect iOS/mobile UX anti-patterns and fail CI when they're found.

**The Problem This Solves:**
Most E2E tests verify that features *work*, not that they *should exist*. A hamburger menu test might verify "does the menu open?" but never asks "should there be a hamburger menu at all?" This skill creates tests that enforce UX standards.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User wants to add mobile UX checks to CI
- User says "add UX pattern tests", "detect anti-patterns", "iOS UX CI checks"
- User wants to prevent mobile UX regressions
- User is building a PWA or web app targeting iOS/mobile

## Process

### Phase 1: Assess Current Testing Infrastructure [DELEGATE TO AGENT]

**Purpose:** Explore the codebase to understand the current testing setup. Delegate this to an Explore agent to save context.

**Use the Task tool to spawn an Explore agent:**

```
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "Explore"
- model: "sonnet"
- prompt: |
    You are assessing a project's testing infrastructure for mobile UX CI tests.

    ## What to Find

    1. **Playwright Configuration**
       - Search for `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js`
       - Check `package.json` for `@playwright/test` dependency
       - Note the Playwright version if installed

    2. **Existing E2E Tests**
       - Look in `e2e/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, or similar directories
       - Count existing test files
       - Note any mobile-specific test files

    3. **Mobile Testing Setup**
       - Check Playwright config for mobile viewport projects
       - Search for existing mobile test files (`*mobile*`, `*ios*`)
       - Look for device emulation settings

    4. **Test Utilities**
       - Find test helper files (`test-utils.ts`, `helpers.ts`)
       - Note any existing page object patterns
       - Find authentication/setup utilities

    ## Return Format

    ```
    ## Testing Infrastructure Report

    ### Playwright Status
    - Installed: [Yes/No]
    - Version: [version or N/A]
    - Config file: [path or N/A]

    ### Existing Tests
    - Test directory: [path]
    - Test file count: [count]
    - Mobile-specific tests: [count or None]

    ### Mobile Configuration
    - Mobile viewports configured: [Yes/No]
    - Device presets: [list or None]

    ### Test Utilities
    - Helper files: [list or None]
    - Page objects: [Yes/No]
    - Auth utilities: [Yes/No]

    ### Recommendation
    - [Add to existing / Create new / Needs Playwright setup]
    ```
```

**After agent returns:** Based on the infrastructure report, ask the user their goal:
- **Add to existing**: Add UX pattern tests to existing Playwright setup
- **Create new**: Set up Playwright and add UX pattern tests
- **Audit only**: Generate a report of current anti-patterns without creating tests

### Phase 2: Understand the App [DELEGATE TO AGENT]

**Purpose:** Explore the app's structure to identify what pages/routes need UX pattern testing. Delegate this to an Explore agent to save context.

**Use the Task tool to spawn an Explore agent:**

```
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "Explore"
- model: "sonnet"
- prompt: |
    You are exploring a web application to identify pages that need mobile UX testing.

    ## What to Find

    1. **Routes and Pages**
       - Find all routes (React Router, Next.js pages, Vue Router, etc.)
       - List all user-facing pages
       - Note the base URL (likely localhost:5173 or similar)

    2. **Entry Points**
       - How does a user enter the app? (login, onboarding, direct access)
       - Is authentication required?
       - What's the first page users see?

    3. **Key Screens to Test**
       - Navigation screens (where nav patterns matter most)
       - Form screens (where touch targets matter)
       - List/table screens (where scrolling matters)
       - Modal/dialog screens (where presentation matters)

    4. **Existing Test Patterns**
       - Look for test utilities already mentioned in Phase 1
       - Find any app-specific selectors (data-testid patterns)
       - Note authentication helpers if they exist

    ## Return Format

    ```
    ## App Structure Report

    ### Base URL
    - Development: [URL]

    ### Entry Flow
    - Auth required: [Yes/No]
    - Entry point: [page/route]
    - First user screen: [page name]

    ### Pages to Test (prioritized)
    | Page | Route | Why Test |
    |------|-------|----------|
    | Home | / | Primary navigation visible |
    | Dashboard | /dashboard | Contains lists, buttons |
    | Settings | /settings | Form inputs, toggles |

    ### Navigation Pattern
    - Primary nav type: [tab bar / sidebar / hamburger / etc.]
    - Location: [top / bottom / left]

    ### Selector Patterns
    - data-testid usage: [Yes/No]
    - Common patterns: [list]
    ```
```

**After agent returns:** Use the app structure report to determine which pages to include in the UX pattern tests and how to set up test navigation.

### Phase 3: Generate UX Pattern Tests

Create a `mobile-ux-patterns.spec.ts` file with tests for:

#### Navigation Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong | What to Test |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Hamburger menu | iOS uses tab bars | `.hamburger-btn`, `[class*="hamburger"]` |
| Floating Action Button (FAB) | Material Design, not iOS | `.fab`, `[class*="floating-action"]` |
| Breadcrumb navigation | iOS uses back button | `.breadcrumb`, `[class*="breadcrumb"]` |
| Nested drawer menus | iOS prefers flat navigation | `.drawer`, `[class*="drawer"]` |

#### Touch Target Issues
| Issue | Standard | What to Test |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Small buttons | iOS: 44x44pt, WCAG: 24x24px | `boundingBox()` on all `button, a, [role="button"]` |
| Targets too close | 8px minimum spacing | Measure distance between interactive elements |

#### Component Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | iOS Alternative | What to Test |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Native `<select>` | iOS picker wheels | `select:visible` count |
| Checkboxes | Toggle switches | `input[type="checkbox"]` count |
| Material snackbars | iOS alerts/banners | `.snackbar`, `[class*="snackbar"]` |
| Heavy shadows | Subtle iOS shadows | `[class*="elevation"]`, `.shadow-xl` |

#### Layout Issues
| Issue | What to Test |
|-------|--------------|
| Horizontal overflow | `body.scrollWidth > html.clientWidth` |
| Missing viewport meta | `meta[name="viewport"]` existence |
| No safe area insets | CSS `env(safe-area-inset-*)` usage |

#### Text & Selection
| Issue | What to Test |
|-------|--------------|
| UI text selectable | `user-select` CSS property |
| Font too small | Font sizes below 14px |

#### Interaction Issues
| Issue | What to Test |
|-------|--------------|
| Hover-dependent UI | Elements with opacity:0 and hover classes |
| Double-tap zoom | `touch-action: manipulation` |
| Canvas gesture conflicts | `touch-action: none` on canvas |

### Phase 4: Test File Template

Generate a test file following this structure:

```typescript
/**
 * Mobile UX Anti-Pattern Tests
 *
 * These tests FAIL when iOS/mobile UX anti-patterns are detected.
 * Reference: Apple HIG, Material Design vs iOS differences
 */

import { test, expect, Page } from '@playwright/test';

// Viewport sizes
const IPHONE_14 = { width: 393, height: 852 };

// Apple's minimum touch target
const IOS_MIN_TOUCH_TARGET = 44;

// Helper to enter the app (customize per project)
async function enterApp(page: Page) {
  await page.goto('/');
  // Add app-specific setup here
}

test.describe('Navigation Anti-Patterns', () => {
  test('ANTI-PATTERN: Hamburger menu should not exist', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.setViewportSize(IPHONE_14);
    await enterApp(page);

    const hamburger = page.locator('.hamburger-btn, [class*="hamburger"]').first();
    const isVisible = await hamburger.isVisible().catch(() => false);

    expect(isVisible, 'iOS anti-pattern: Hamburger menu detected').toBe(false);
  });

  // ... more navigation tests
});

test.describe('Touch Target Sizes', () => {
  test('All interactive elements meet iOS 44pt minimum', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.setViewportSize(IPHONE_14);
    await enterApp(page);

    const buttons = await page.locator('button:visible').all();
    const violations: string[] = [];

    for (const btn of buttons) {
      const box = await btn.boundingBox();
      if (box && (box.width < IOS_MIN_TOUCH_TARGET || box.height < IOS_MIN_TOUCH_TARGET)) {
        violations.push(`Button ${box.width}x${box.height}px`);
      }
    }

    expect(violations.length, `${violations.length} touch targets too small`).toBe(0);
  });
});

// ... more test categories
```

### Phase 5: CI Integration

Ensure tests run in CI by:

1. Adding to existing Playwright CI workflow
2. Or creating new workflow:

```yaml
name: Mobile UX Checks

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  mobile-ux:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install chromium
      - run: npm run dev &
      - run: npx playwright test mobile-ux-patterns.spec.ts
```

### Phase 6: Review with User

Present:
1. Summary of anti-patterns that will be detected
2. Which tests will fail immediately (known issues)
3. Which tests will pass (good patterns already in place)

Ask user:
- Should any anti-patterns be allowed temporarily?
- Any additional patterns to check?
- Ready to add to CI?

## Anti-Pattern Reference

### Critical (Should Always Fail CI)

1. **Hamburger Menu for Primary Navigation**
   - Why: iOS users expect tab bars at bottom
   - Reference: [iOS vs Android Navigation](https://www.learnui.design/blog/ios-vs-android-app-ui-design-complete-guide.html)

2. **Floating Action Button (FAB)**
   - Why: Material Design pattern, not iOS
   - Reference: [Material vs iOS](https://medium.com/@helenastening/material-design-v-s-ios-11-b4f87857814a)

3. **Touch Targets < 44pt**
   - Why: Apple HIG requirement for accessibility
   - Reference: [Apple HIG](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)

4. **Horizontal Overflow**
   - Why: Content should fit viewport on mobile
   - Reference: Basic responsive design

### Warning (Should Log but May Not Fail)

1. **Native `<select>` Elements**
   - Why: iOS apps use picker wheels
   - Note: Some selects are acceptable for accessibility

2. **Checkboxes**
   - Why: iOS uses toggle switches
   - Note: Checkmarks in lists are acceptable

3. **Text Selection on UI**
   - Why: Native apps prevent selecting UI text
   - Note: Content text should remain selectable

4. **No Safe Area Insets**
   - Why: Content may go under notch
   - Note: Only relevant for notched devices

### Informational (Suggestions Only)

1. **Heavy Shadows (Material Elevation)**
2. **Missing touch-action: manipulation**
3. **Non-system fonts**

## Customization Points

When generating tests, ask about:

1. **Severity levels**: Which anti-patterns should fail CI vs warn?
2. **Exceptions**: Any patterns that are intentionally kept?
3. **Additional patterns**: App-specific anti-patterns to detect?
4. **Viewport sizes**: Which devices to test?

## Example Output

After running this skill, the user should have:

1. `e2e/mobile-ux-patterns.spec.ts` - Comprehensive anti-pattern tests
2. Updated CI workflow (if needed)
3. Clear documentation of what's being checked
4. Immediate visibility into current anti-patterns
